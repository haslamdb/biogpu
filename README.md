# BioGPU: GPU-Accelerated Microbial Profiling and Antimicrobial Resistance Detection

## Overview

BioGPU is a domain-specific programming language and computational framework designed to accelerate microbial community profiling and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection using GPU computing. Initially focused on fluoroquinolone resistance detection through mutations in DNA gyrase (gyrA/gyrB) and topoisomerase IV (parC/parE) genes, BioGPU aims to provide real-time metagenomic analysis capabilities for clinical decision-making.

## Project Status: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**

The BioGPU pipeline has been successfully tested with synthetic and real metagenomic data, demonstrating:
- **High performance**: Processing ~1M reads efficiently with 10K read batches
- **Excellent sensitivity**: High candidate detection rate from k-mer filtering
- **Good specificity**: 67% alignment success rate preventing false positives
- **Clinical readiness**: Real FQ resistance index (115MB, 230K unique k-mers) validated

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Rapid Microbial Community Profiling**: Map sequencing reads to comprehensive microbial genome databases to determine community structure and relative abundances in real-time
2. **Fluoroquinolone Resistance Detection**: Identify known resistance mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) and plasmid-mediated resistance genes
3. **Clinical Integration**: Generate actionable reports linking detected resistance to specific organisms with confidence scores for informed treatment decisions

### Technical Innovation
- Native GPU acceleration for bioinformatics operations
- Domain-specific language that abstracts GPU complexity while maintaining performance
- Automatic optimization of sequence alignment algorithms for GPU architecture
- Real-time processing capabilities suitable for clinical environments

# BioGPU: GPU-Accelerated Microbial Profiling and Antimicrobial Resistance Detection

## Overview

BioGPU is a domain-specific programming language and computational framework designed to accelerate microbial community profiling and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection using GPU computing. Initially focused on fluoroquinolone resistance detection through mutations in DNA gyrase (gyrA/gyrB) and topoisomerase IV (parC/parE) genes, BioGPU aims to provide real-time metagenomic analysis capabilities for clinical decision-making.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Rapid Microbial Community Profiling**: Map sequencing reads to comprehensive microbial genome databases to determine community structure and relative abundances in real-time
2. **Fluoroquinolone Resistance Detection**: Identify known resistance mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) and plasmid-mediated resistance genes
3. **Clinical Integration**: Generate actionable reports linking detected resistance to specific organisms with confidence scores for informed treatment decisions

### Technical Innovation
- Native GPU acceleration for bioinformatics operations
- Domain-specific language that abstracts GPU complexity while maintaining performance
- Automatic optimization of sequence alignment algorithms for GPU architecture
- Real-time processing capabilities suitable for clinical environments

## Architecture

### Pipeline Structure
```
Raw Reads → Quality Control → Community Profiling → AMR Detection → Organism Attribution → Clinical Report
```

### Key Components

1. **BioGPU DSL**: High-level language for expressing bioinformatics pipelines
   - Intuitive syntax for pipeline definition
   - Built-in bioinformatics operations
   - Automatic GPU optimization

2. **Core Data Structures** (`biogpu_core.h`):
   - Compressed read storage for GPU efficiency
   - Resistance graph representation
   - GPU-optimized mutation indices
   - Community and resistance profile structures

3. **GPU Kernels**:
   - Sequence compression and indexing
   - Mutation scanning with Bloom filters
   - Community profiling algorithms
   - Resistance attribution logic

4. **VS Code Extension**: Syntax highlighting and code completion for BioGPU language

## Example Usage

```biogpu
pipeline FluoroquinoloneResistance {
    input: {
        patient_reads: fastq_file,
        patient_id: string,
        fq_concentration: float optional
    }
    
    output: {
        resistance_report: json,
        abundance_table: csv,
        clinical_summary: pdf
    }
    
    @gpu_kernel
    stage profile_microbiome {
        alignments = parallel_map(filtered_reads, microbe_genomes) {
            algorithm: minimap2_gpu,
            min_identity: 0.95
        }
        
        abundance = calculate_abundance(alignments) {
            method: "relative_abundance"
        }
    }
    
    @gpu_kernel
    stage detect_fq_resistance {
        mutations = scan_mutations(target_reads, fq_mutations) {
            positions: {
                gyrA: [83, 87],
                parC: [80, 84]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Clinical Applications

- **Pediatric UTI Management**: Rapid detection of fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens
- **C. difficile Surveillance**: Monitor resistance patterns in hospital settings
- **Empiric Therapy Guidance**: Inform antibiotic selection based on community resistance profiles
- **Outbreak Investigation**: Track emergence and spread of resistant organisms

## Performance Targets

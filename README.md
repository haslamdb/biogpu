# BioGPU: GPU-Accelerated Microbial Profiling and Antimicrobial Resistance Detection

## Overview

BioGPU is a domain-specific programming language and computational framework designed to accelerate microbial community profiling and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection using GPU computing. Initially focused on fluoroquinolone resistance detection through mutations in DNA gyrase (gyrA/gyrB) and topoisomerase IV (parC/parE) genes, BioGPU aims to provide real-time metagenomic analysis capabilities for clinical decision-making.

        float best_score = 0;

            } else {
                best_score -= 0.5;  // Penalize mismatches
                consecutive_matches = 0;
            }
            
            // Bonus for long consecutive matches

            },
            min_extension_score: 10.0
        }
        
        # Step 4: Resolve ambiguous assignments

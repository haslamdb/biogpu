# Archive: 2025-06-28_streaming-minimizer-taxonomy-working

## Purpose
This archive captures the working state of the enhanced Kraken2-like profiler with streaming minimizer extraction and taxonomy integration functionality.

## State Summary
- **Date**: June 28, 2025
- **Status**: Working implementation with GPU-accelerated database building and taxonomy integration
- **Key Features**:
  - GPU-accelerated minimizer extraction from genomic sequences
  - Compact hash table implementation for k-mer to taxon mapping
  - Streaming processing for large-scale genomic data
  - Integration with NCBI taxonomy database
  - Test suite for taxonomy integration

## Recent Work
- Implemented compact GPU taxonomy structure
- Added genome file processing with FASTA/FNA support
- Created test framework for taxonomy integration
- Optimized memory usage for large-scale database construction

## Files of Interest
- `gpu/gpu_database_kernels.cu` - Core GPU kernels for database operations
- `processing/genome_file_processor.cu` - FASTA/FNA file processing
- `test_taxonomy_integration.cu` - Test suite for taxonomy features
- `Makefile.test_taxonomy` - Build configuration for tests

## Build Instructions
```bash
cd enhanced_k2like
make -f Makefile.test_taxonomy
./test_taxonomy_integration
```

## Next Steps
This archive was created before implementing expanded minimizer feature set as requested.

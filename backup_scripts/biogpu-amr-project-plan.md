# BioGPU: GPU-Accelerated Microbial Community Profiling with AMR Detection

## Project Overview

**Primary Goal**: Develop a GPU-accelerated pipeline for rapid microbial community profiling with integrated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, initially focusing on fluoroquinolone resistance.

**Clinical Application**: Enable real-time metagenomic analysis for pediatric infectious disease diagnostics, particularly for identifying resistant pathogens in complex microbial communities.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Rapid Microbial Community Profiling
- Map short reads to comprehensive microbial genome database
- Generate normalized abundance profiles
- Achieve real-time performance for clinical decision-making

### 2. Fluoroquinolone Resistance Detection
- Target key resistance sites: gyrA, gyrB (DNA gyrase), parC, parE (topoisomerase IV)
- Detect known QRDR (Quinolone Resistance-Determining Region) mutations
- Include plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes: qnr, aac(6')-Ib-cr, oqxAB, qepA

### 3. Resistance-Organism Attribution
- Link detected resistance mutations to source organisms
- Build local assembly graphs around resistance sites
- Resolve ambiguous assignments in mixed communities

### 4. Clinical Reporting
- Normalized resistance gene/mutation abundance
- Confidence scores for organism-resistance associations
- Actionable clinical interpretation

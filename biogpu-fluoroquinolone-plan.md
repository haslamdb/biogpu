# BioGPU: GPU-Accelerated Fluoroquinolone Resistance Detection Pipeline

## Refined Project Overview

**Primary Goal**: Develop a GPU-accelerated pipeline for rapid metagenomic read mapping and fluoroquinolone resistance detection in microbial communities.

**Clinical Application**: Enable real-time detection of antibiotic resistance patterns in patient samples for informed treatment decisions.

## Two-Stage Pipeline Architecture

### Stage 1: Rapid Metagenomic Mapping
- Map sequencing reads to comprehensive microbial genome database
- Determine community composition and relative abundances
- Identify species/strains present in sample

### Stage 2: Resistance Mutation Detection
- Target DNA gyrase (gyrA/gyrB) and topoisomerase IV (parC/parE) genes
- Detect known resistance mutations (especially QRDR mutations)
- Report resistance profile with confidence scores

## Technical Implementation

### Language Syntax Example
```biogpu
pipeline FluoroquinoloneResistance {
    input: fastq_file patient_reads,
    reference: genome_db microbes,
    reference: mutation_db qrdr_mutations,
    output: resistance_report results
    
    // Stage 1: Community profiling
    @gpu_kernel
    stage map_microbiome {
        parallel_map(patient_reads, microbes) {
            algorithm: minimap2_gpu,
            min_identity: 0.95,
            min_length: 100,
            gpu_config: {
                blocks: auto,
                shared_memory: 48KB
            }
        }
    } -> abundance_table
    
    // Stage 2: Resistance detection
    @gpu_kernel
    stage detect_resistance {
        // Extract reads mapping to resistance genes
        target_reads = extract_gene_reads(
            mapped_reads: stage.map_microbiome.alignments,
            gene_list: ["gyrA", "gyrB", "parC", "parE"],
            flank_size: 200
        )
        
        // Check for known mutations
        parallel_scan(target_reads, qrdr_mutations) {
            algorithm: exact_match,
            positions: [
                gyrA: [83, 87],  // Common QRDR positions
                parC: [80, 84]
            ],
            report_variants: true
        }
    } -> resistance_mutations
    
    // Generate clinical report
    stage report {
        summarize(abundance_table, resistance_mutations) {
            format: clinical_report,
            confidence_threshold: 0.95
        }
    }
}
```

## Resistance Mutation Database Schema

```biogpu
struct ResistanceMutation {
    gene: string,           // e.g., "gyrA"
    position: int,          // e.g., 83
    wild_type: char,        // e.g., 'S'
    mutant: char,           // e.g., 'L'
    resistance_level: enum {LOW, MODERATE, HIGH},
    drugs_affected: list<string>,  // e.g., ["ciprofloxacin", "levofloxacin"]
    pmid: list<int>         // Literature references
}

// Example entries
database fluoroquinolone_mutations {
    // E. coli mutations
    {gene: "gyrA", position: 83, wild_type: 'S', mutant: 'L', 
     resistance_level: HIGH, drugs_affected: ["ciprofloxacin", "levofloxacin"]},
    {gene: "gyrA", position: 87, wild_type: 'D', mutant: 'N', 
     resistance_level: MODERATE, drugs_affected: ["ciprofloxacin"]},
    
    // S. aureus mutations
    {gene: "grlA", position: 80, wild_type: 'S', mutant: 'F',
     resistance_level: HIGH, drugs_affected: ["ciprofloxacin", "moxifloxacin"]},
    
    // P. aeruginosa mutations
    {gene: "gyrA", position: 83, wild_type: 'T', mutant: 'I',
     resistance_level: HIGH, drugs_affected: ["ciprofloxacin", "levofloxacin"]}
}
```

## GPU Optimization Strategies

### Memory Layout for Sequences
```cpp
// Coalesced memory access pattern
struct SequenceBatch {
    // Store sequences in column-major format for coalescing
    char sequences[SEQ_LENGTH][BATCH_SIZE];  
    
    // Metadata in structure of arrays
    int sequence_lengths[BATCH_SIZE];
    int species_ids[BATCH_SIZE];
};
```

### Mutation Detection Kernel
```cpp
__global__ void detect_qrdr_mutations(
    SequenceBatch* reads,
    MutationDatabase* mutations,
    ResistanceResult* results,
    int num_reads
) {
    int tid = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    
    // Use shared memory for mutation database
    __shared__ ResistanceMutation shared_mutations[MAX_MUTATIONS];
    
    // Cooperative loading of mutation database
    if (threadIdx.x < num_mutations) {
        shared_mutations[threadIdx.x] = mutations->entries[threadIdx.x];
    }
    __syncthreads();
    
    if (tid < num_reads) {
        // Process read and check all mutation positions
        check_mutations(reads->sequences[tid], shared_mutations, results[tid]);
    }
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

## Clinical Validation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Compare with PCR-based resistance tests
2. **Phase 2**: Validate against phenotypic AST results
3. **Phase 3**: Prospective clinical trial in pediatric UTI cases

## Next Steps

1. **Expand your CUDA prototype**:

   - Implement codon-aware mutation detection
   - Add coverage depth calculation

2. **Build reference databases**:
   - Curate pathogen genome database
   - Compile validated resistance mutations
   - Create test datasets with known resistance

3. **Develop BioGPU compiler**:
   - Start with simple DSL for your use case
   - Generate optimized CUDA from high-level descriptions
   - Focus on bioinformatics-specific optimizations

Would you like me to help you expand your CUDA prototype to handle multiple genes and more sophisticated mutation detection? Or shall we start designing the domain-specific language syntax for expressing these bioinformatics pipelines?

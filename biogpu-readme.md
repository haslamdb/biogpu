# BioGPU

A domain-specific programming language for GPU-accelerated DNA sequence mapping to microbial genome databases.

## Overview

BioGPU provides native GPU support for bioinformatics operations with automatic optimization for sequence alignment algorithms. It's designed to accelerate microbial genome analysis and metagenomics workflows by leveraging modern GPU architectures.

### Key Features

- **Native GPU acceleration** for sequence alignment algorithms
- **Domain-specific syntax** designed for bioinformatics workflows
- **Automatic optimization** of memory access patterns for biological data
- **Built-in support** for common formats (FASTA, FASTQ, SAM/BAM)
- **Parallel primitives** optimized for genomic operations

## Example

```biogpu
pipeline MapMicrobiome {
    input: fastq_file reads,
    reference: genome_db microbes,
    output: abundance_table results
    
    @gpu_kernel
    stage align {
        parallel_map(reads, microbes) {
            algorithm: bwa_mem,
            min_score: 30,
            gpu_config: auto
        }
    }
}
```

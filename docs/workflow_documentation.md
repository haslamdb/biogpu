## 🔄 Current Pipeline Workflow

### Stage 0: Data Acquisition and Database Building

#### 1. Download Reference Sequences
```bash
python src/python/download_ncbi_20250529.py \
    data/Known_Quinolone_Changes.csv \
    data/fq_genes \
    --email your_email@example.com \
    --max-per-gene 300
```

This downloads resistance gene sequences (gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE) from multiple species based on the Known_Quinolone_Changes.csv file.

#### 2. Build Integrated Clean Database (Protein and Nucleotide)

The database is generated by:
```bash
# Minimal command using all defaults
python3 src/python/build_clean_dynamic_database.py \
    --mutations-csv data/quinolone_resistance_mutation_table.csv
```

This builds both protein and nucleotide k-mer indices with the following defaults:
- **Protein sequences**: `data/wildtype_protein_seqs` (positional arg 1 to override)
- **Output directory**: `data/integrated_clean_db` (positional arg 2 to override)
- **Nucleotide sequences**: `data/fq_genes` (use `--nucleotide-sequences` to override)
- **Protein k-mer length**: 8 (use `--kmer-length` to override)
- **Nucleotide k-mer length**: 15 (use `--nucleotide-kmer-length` to override)
- **Reverse complement**: Enabled (use `--no-rc` to disable)

Example with all options specified:
```bash
python3 src/python/build_clean_dynamic_database.py \
    /custom/protein/dir \                    # Override protein input directory
    /custom/output/dir \                      # Override output directory
    --mutations-csv /path/to/mutations.csv \  # Required: mutations CSV file
    --nucleotide-sequences /custom/nucl/dir \ # Override nucleotide sequences directory
    --kmer-length 10 \                        # Override protein k-mer length
    --nucleotide-kmer-length 20 \             # Override nucleotide k-mer length
    --no-rc                                   # Disable reverse complement k-mers
```

The database builder (`build_clean_dynamic_database.py`):
- Reads wildtype protein sequences from `data/wildtype_protein_seqs/`
- Reads nucleotide sequences from `data/fq_genes/` (JSON format from NCBI download)
- Discovers species and genes by parsing headers
- Creates both protein and nucleotide k-mer indices in one run
- Assigns dynamic IDs to discovered species and genes
- Optionally loads known mutations from CSV

**Note**: The `enhanced_kmer_builder.py` script is no longer required as both nucleotide and protein k-mer building functionality is now integrated into `build_clean_dynamic_database.py`.

This creates:
- **Nucleotide index**: 15-mer k-mer index from downloaded sequences
  - Binary format for fast GPU searching
  - Includes reverse complement k-mers by default
  - Located in `nucleotide/` subdirectory
- **Protein database**: Translated protein sequences with 8-mer index
  - From wildtype protein sequences
  - Located in `protein/` subdirectory
- **Resistance mappings**: Gene-species-position mappings for known mutations

**Key Features of Integrated Database**:
- Species-aware gene tracking (e.g., Enterococcus_faecium_gyrA vs E.coli_gyrA)
- Position-only mutation information (no drug/resistance level data in clean version)
- Both nucleotide and protein search capabilities
- Consistent ID mappings across all components

### Stage 1: GPU Pipeline Execution

#### Running the Clean Resistance Pipeline

**Recommended Command (Optimized Performance)**:
```bash
./build/clean_resistance_pipeline \
    data/integrated_clean_db/nucleotide \
    data/integrated_clean_db/protein \
    reads_R1.fastq.gz \
    reads_R2.fastq.gz \
    output_prefix \
    data/quinolone_resistance_mutation_table.csv \
    --no-bloom
```

**Rationale**: Based on performance testing (June 8, 2025):
- `--no-bloom` provides ~6% performance improvement (212,813 vs 200,295 reads/sec)
- Bloom filter has minimal impact on results (same 1,326 protein matches)
- Smith-Waterman should remain ENABLED for sensitivity (30% more matches: 1,326 vs 922)
- This configuration balances speed and accuracy

**Alternative Commands**:
```bash
# Maximum sensitivity (default - slower)
./build/clean_resistance_pipeline \
    data/integrated_clean_db/nucleotide \
    data/integrated_clean_db/protein \
    reads_R1.fastq.gz reads_R2.fastq.gz output_prefix \
    data/quinolone_resistance_mutation_table.csv

# Maximum speed (least sensitive)
./build/clean_resistance_pipeline \
    data/integrated_clean_db/nucleotide \
    data/integrated_clean_db/protein \
    reads_R1.fastq.gz reads_R2.fastq.gz output_prefix \
    data/quinolone_resistance_mutation_table.csv \
    --no-bloom --no-sw
```

**Pipeline Stages**:

1. **Bloom Filter Pre-screening** (Optional, default ON - **recommend OFF**)
   - Fast k-mer presence check
   - Minimal performance benefit (~6% improvement when disabled)
   - No impact on sensitivity when disabled
   - Recommendation: Use `--no-bloom` for better performance

2. **Nucleotide K-mer Matching** (Optional, default ON)
   - Binary search in sorted k-mer index
   - Species and gene-aware tracking
   - Identifies candidate resistance genes

3. **6-Frame Translated Search with Smith-Waterman**
   - Translates reads in all 6 frames
   - 8-mer protein k-mer seeding for efficiency
   - Smith-Waterman alignment for high-scoring matches
   - Enhanced mutation detection against known wildtype sequences

### Stage 2: Enhanced Mutation Detection

The new `enhanced_mutation_detection.cu` module compares observed sequences against known wildtype amino acids at resistance positions:

```cpp
// Known resistance positions are checked against wildtype
struct ResistancePosition {
    uint32_t gene_id;
    uint16_t position;      // 1-based amino acid position
    char wildtype_aa;       // Expected wildtype
    char resistant_aas[8];  // Known resistant variants
    float resistance_score;
};
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Wildtype-aware mutation calling (not dependent on reference being wildtype)
- Species-specific resistance pattern detection
- QRDR region coverage tracking
- Identity calculation based on wildtype comparison

### Stage 3: Output Generation

The pipeline generates multiple output files:

1. **HDF5 File** (`output_prefix.h5`)
   - All alignment data
   - Nucleotide and protein results
   - Structured for downstream analysis

2. **JSON Results** (`output_prefix.json`)
   - Human-readable resistance calls
   - Mutation details with positions
   - Pipeline statistics

3. **CSV Report** (`output_prefix_protein_matches.csv`)
   - All protein alignments with mutation details
   - QRDR coverage information (`is_qrdr_alignment` flag)
   - Species and gene identification

4. **Clinical Reports** (NEW in v0.6.0)
   - `output_prefix_clinical_fq_report.html` - Web-viewable clinical report
   - `output_prefix_clinical_fq_report.json` - Machine-readable clinical data
   - `output_prefix_clinical_fq_report.txt` - Text summary
   - Includes confidence scoring and clinical interpretation

## 🎉 Key Changes in Version 0.6.0 (June 8, 2025)

### Major Fixes and Improvements

1. **Fixed QRDR Detection**
   - `is_qrdr_alignment` now properly set on host side after protein matches
   - Checks if alignments or mutations fall within QRDR regions
   - Uses FQ resistance database for accurate QRDR position identification

2. **Fixed Species/Gene ID Mapping**
   - Resolved issue where all genes showed as "unknown"
   - Fixed metadata loading that was blocked by disabled fq_mutation_reporter
   - Now correctly identifies species (e.g., Escherichia_coli) and genes (e.g., gyrA)

3. **New Clinical Report Generator**
   - Comprehensive clinical reports in HTML, JSON, and text formats
   - Confidence scoring (0-95%) for resistance detection
   - Clinical interpretation with actionable recommendations

## 🐛 Known Issues and TODOs

### TODO for Next Version
1. **Apply bloom_and_sw_flags.patch**
   - Add command-line flags to enable/disable Bloom filter
   - Add command-line flags to enable/disable Smith-Waterman alignment
   - This will allow users to control pipeline stages for performance tuning
   - See `docs/bloom_sw_configuration_guide.md` for implementation details

### Current Known Issues
1. **Bloom filter showing 0% pass rate**
   - All reads are failing Bloom filter check
   - Pipeline still works because protein search is independent
   - Needs investigation - may be related to k-mer size or filter parameters

2. **No nucleotide matches reported**
   - Possibly related to Bloom filter issue
   - Nucleotide k-mer matching stage may be bypassed

3. **CSV parsing error**
   - Error parsing qnrB19 entries with "NA" position
   - Non-critical - other mutations still processed correctly

### Optimization Opportunities
- Performance optimization for large-scale datasets
- Memory usage optimization for protein database
- Parallel processing of paired-end reads

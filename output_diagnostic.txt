MUTATION ANALYSIS
=================

‚ùå NO MUTATIONS DETECTED

Possible reasons:
1. Database contains mutant references - reads match perfectly
2. Mutation calling threshold too stringent
3. Alignment quality issues
4. Reads are actually wild-type


QRDR RESISTANCE ANALYSIS
========================

QRDR Coverage:
  gyrA QRDR: ‚úì COVERED
  parC QRDR: ‚ùå NOT COVERED
  gyrB QRDR: ‚ùå NOT COVERED
  parE QRDR: ‚ùå NOT COVERED

Fluoroquinolone Resistance Assessment:
‚ùå NO RESISTANCE MUTATIONS DETECTED
  Recommendation: Fluoroquinolones may be effective
  Note: Check mutation detection logic if mutant reads were expected

TROUBLESHOOTING ADVICE
======================

üîç ALIGNMENTS FOUND BUT NO MUTATIONS DETECTED
Most likely cause: MUTANT REFERENCE DATABASE

Your protein database appears to contain mutant sequences.
When mutant reads align to mutant references, they match perfectly
and no 'mutations' are detected.

Solutions:
1. Use wild-type reference database for mutation calling
2. Implement variant-aware analysis that compares to known resistance patterns
3. Use the alignment positions to infer resistance without mutation calling

Next Steps:
1. Review top alignments above for quality
2. Check if alignments are in expected QRDR regions
3. Verify database contains appropriate reference sequences
4. Consider adjusting alignment thresholds if needed

# GPU Memory Management Fixes - Phase 3 Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Protein Database Reloading Issue**
**Problem**: The protein database was being reloaded for each batch, causing:
- Unnecessary GPU memory allocation/deallocation
- Performance degradation
- Memory fragmentation

**Fix**: 
- Modified `AMRDetectionPipeline` to load the database only once during initialization
- Added static flag to track database loading status
- Modified reset function to retain database in GPU memory
- See: `amr_detection_pipeline_memory_fix.patch`

### 2. **Memory Allocation Size Mismatches**
**Problem**: 
- `d_reads` allocated for single read length but merged reads are 2x longer
- `d_minimizer_offsets` needed `batch_size + 1` elements, not just `batch_size`

**Fix**:
- Properly calculate memory for merged paired-end reads: `(max_read_length * 2) + 100`
- Fixed offset array allocation to include the extra element
- Added buffer for very long reads (min 1000 bases)

### 3. **GPU Memory Fragmentation**
**Problem**: Repeated allocation/deallocation causing fragmentation and "invalid argument" errors

**Solution**: Created `gpu_memory_pool.h` with:
- Singleton memory pool manager
- Per-GPU device memory pools
- Memory block reuse to prevent fragmentation
- RAII wrapper classes for automatic memory management
- Statistics tracking for debugging

### 4. **CUDA Error State Persistence**
**Problem**: CUDA errors not being cleared, causing cascade failures

**Fix**:
- Clear pre-existing CUDA errors before operations
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Don't destroy/recreate engine on every error

## New Components Created

### 1. **GPU Memory Pool** (`shared/gpu_memory_pool.h`)
```cpp
// Usage example:
auto& pool = GPUMemoryPool::getInstance();
void* mem = pool.allocate(size_bytes, gpu_device);
// ... use memory ...
pool.deallocate(mem);

// Or with RAII:
GPUMemoryHandle<float> buffer(1000000);  // 1M floats
float* data = buffer.get();
```

### 2. **Improved Translated Search Engine** (`genes/translated_search_amr_fixed.h`)
- Singleton protein database manager
- Proper memory lifecycle management
- Statistics tracking
- Multi-GPU support with shared databases

### 3. **Memory Fix Patch** (`genes/amr_detection_pipeline_memory_fix.patch`)
Apply with: `patch -p0 < amr_detection_pipeline_memory_fix.patch`

## Performance Improvements

1. **Database Loading**: From every batch → Once per pipeline run
2. **Memory Allocation**: From every batch → Reused from pool
3. **Error Recovery**: From engine recreation → Simple state reset

## Recommendations for Integration

1. **Apply the patch** to `amr_detection_pipeline.cpp`
2. **Include GPU memory pool** in the unified pipeline
3. **Update CMakeLists.txt** to include new headers
4. **Set memory pool configuration** based on GPU:
   - RTX A6000 (48GB): Max pool 40GB
   - RTX A5000 (24GB): Max pool 20GB

## Testing Strategy

1. **Memory Leak Test**: Process 1M+ reads and monitor GPU memory
2. **Error Recovery Test**: Inject CUDA errors and verify recovery
3. **Multi-GPU Test**: Run both pipelines simultaneously on different GPUs
4. **Performance Test**: Measure throughput improvement

## Expected Results

- No more "invalid argument" CUDA errors after first batch
- Stable GPU memory usage (no growth over time)
- 10-20% performance improvement from avoiding database reloads
- Better GPU utilization with memory pooling

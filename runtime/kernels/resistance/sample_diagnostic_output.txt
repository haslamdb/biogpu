  Clinical significance: Moderate fluoroquinolone resistance - consider higher dose or alternative
  Located in QRDR region - critical for resistance
✓ DETECTED: grlA_S80F (confidence: 96.80%)
  Clinical significance: Fluoroquinolone resistance in MRSA - use alternative antibiotics
  Located in QRDR region - critical for resistance
✓ DETECTED: gyrA_D87N (confidence: 97.90%)
  Clinical significance: High-level fluoroquinolone resistance - contraindicated
  Located in QRDR region - critical for resistance

=== Sample Clinical Interpretation ===
Based on detected mutations:

Sample: diagnostic_test_known_mutations
⚠️  FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANCE DETECTED
Resistance mechanisms:
  • gyrA_S83L
  • gyrA_D87N
  • parC_S80I
  • grlA_S80F

Treatment recommendation:
  - Avoid fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)
  - Consider alternative antibiotics based on susceptibility testing
  - For UTI: nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or beta-lactams
  - For systemic infections: carbapenems or aminoglycosides

Sample: low_frequency_test
⚠️  FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANCE DETECTED
Resistance mechanisms:
  • gyrA_S83L (5.2% frequency)

Treatment recommendation:
  - Low-frequency resistance detected - monitor for treatment failure
  - Consider alternative antibiotics if immunocompromised patient
  - Repeat testing if clinical failure occurs

# alright we're starting with a new profiler workflow at runtime/kernels/profiler
# We now split out CMakeLists.txt into the individual directories so the build locations will be within the kernel subdirectories

# You're in /runtime/kernels/profiler

# 1. Create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# 2. Run CMake to configure the project
cmake ..

# 3. Build everything
make -j4  # The -j4 uses 4 CPU cores for faster compilation

# Or build specific targets:
make test_minimizer         # Just the minimizer test
make test_fastq_pipeline    # Just the FASTQ pipeline
make hybrid_profiler_pipeline  # Just the hybrid profiler

# Test with synthetic data (1000 sequences)
./test_minimizer

# Test with your own FASTQ file
./test_minimizer /path/to/your/reads.fastq

# Run benchmark mode (10,000 sequences)
./test_minimizer --benchmark

# Process a FASTQ file (can be gzipped)
./test_fastq_pipeline /path/to/your/reads.fastq.gz

# Or uncompressed
./test_fastq_pipeline /path/to/your/reads.fastq

# This needs a Kraken2 database
./hybrid_profiler_pipeline /path/to/kraken2_db /path/to/reads.fastq
